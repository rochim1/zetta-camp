                                    <strong>Spider Physiology :</strong>
                                    Spider-Man possesses the powers of a spider,
                                    granted to him from an irradiated common house spider, which bit Peter
                                    Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain
                                    radiation.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Wall Crawling</strong>: Due to his exposure to the mutated spider venom,
                                    Peter
                                    can cling to most surfaces like a spider.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Superhuman Strength</strong> : Spider-Man possesses superhuman strength
                                    enabling him
                                    to press lift
                                    many tons. Originally, Spider-Man
                                    could lift ten tons. After Queen's mutation, he could lift 15 tons. Finally, after
                                    the Other
                                    evolution, he can lift 20 tons. Spider-Man's
                                    physical strength is sufficient enough to enable him to lift and throw objects as
                                    heavy as a
                                    big rig semi-truck with ease.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Superhuman Speed</strong> : Spider-Man has showed to be fast enough to catch
                                    up to
                                    an accelerating car
                                    while on foot, but prefers to travel
                                    by webs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Superhuman Stamina</strong> : At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert
                                    himself
                                    at his peak
                                    capacity for several hours before the buildup
                                    of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him, and is roughly 15 times more
                                    flexible
                                    than a regular human.
                                    Superhuman Reflexes: Spider-Man's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are currently
                                    about 40
                                    times greater than those of an
                                    ordinary human. In combination with his spider-sense, the speed of his reflexes
                                    allows him
                                    to dodge almost any attack, or even gunfire,
                                    if he is far enough away. Spider-Man has even been shown in some cases, to be able
                                    to dodge
                                    gunfire using just his reflexes without
                                    his Spider-Sense.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Regenerative Healing Factor</strong>: Spider-Man has a limited healing
                                    factor. While
                                    not on
                                    Wolverine's
                                    level, it is sufficiently powerful enough
                                    to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage
                                    in a
                                    matter
                                    of days
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Spider-Sense</strong> : Spider-Man possesses a “danger” or “spider” sense
                                    which
                                    warns him of potential
                                    immediate danger by tingling
                                    sensation in the back of his skull. The precise nature of this sense is unknown. It
                                    appears
                                    to
                                    give him super vision and quick response
                                    to a wide variety of phenomena (everything from falling safes to speeding bullets to
                                    thrown
                                    punches), which has given several
                                    hundredths of a second’s warning, which is sufficient time for his reflexes to allow
                                    him to
                                    avoid injury. The sense also can create a
                                    general response on the order of several minutes: he cannot discover the nature of
                                    the
                                    threat by
                                    the sensation. He can, however,
                                    discern the seriousness of the danger by the strength of his response to it.
                                    Spider-Man’s
                                    fighting style incorporates the advantage that
                                    his “spidey-sense” provides him.
