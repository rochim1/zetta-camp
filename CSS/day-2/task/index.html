            <h2>Superheroes</h2>
            <p>When you think of a superhero one normally thinks of Spiderman, Batman, or Superman, but there were
                superheroes long before these characters were created. First one must understand that the basis of this
                name is hero. What is a hero? A hero is a person who does something special or out of the ordinary in
                order to help others. It could also be someone who is admired for a characteristic about them, be it
                physical or mental. They are individuals that normal everyday people can look up to. This being the
                case, a superhero is nothing more then someone who is a hero, but not just that once and for that one
                person, but someone who helps many people, or leads them. </p>
